         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Three things I find cheifly which may be doubted of, or demaunded by thoſe; who are either litle conuerſant in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the holy Church and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Inſtitutions; or els are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religion, which teacheth them to carpe at euery thing, which they doe not comprehend, and to cenſure as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, what their new fancies doth not admitt. To the end therefore that the leſſe learned Catholiks may become ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed and ſatisfied in this matter, it will be neceſſary here in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to take away ſuch ſcruples, and free the holy Church from falſly impoſed errors, &amp; ſuperſtition in the inſtititution and practiſe of ſaying the foreſaid office.</p>
               <p>The principall queſtions or doubts which may be made concerning it are theſe. Firſt by what authoritie and for what end it was inſtituted? 2. ly why it was diuided into ſo many parts or howers? and 3. ly why it is vſually ſaid in

To all which I shall endeauour to giue ſoe cleare &amp; well grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded an ſwears, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake mynds shall haue occaſion to complaine of hardneſſe and obſuritie, nor peruerſe and froward iudgments (if any ſuch happen to peruſe them) shall iuſtly pretend any inſufficiencie or want of ſoliditie in them.</p>
               <p>After theſe generall points are clearely in their order diſcuſſed, and ſome few ſlighter obiections of leſſer moment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, it will be eaſier both for me to proceed to the expoſition of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of the foreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned Office, and for the pious reader to vnderſtand what I shall write.</p>
               <p>Moreouer beſides theſe I haue (for the comfort and inſtruction of deuout but leſſe learned Catholiks) added ſome things to help ſuch of them as recite this holy office, that they may doe ſoe with due reuerence and ſpirituall profit.

               <p>IT is eaſie to be demonſtrated both out of the holy Scriptures, Councells, Fathers, and the practiſe of the holy Church in all ages, that beſides men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall praier, &amp; ſuch vocall praier as euery one vſed priuatlie according to his owne neceſſitie, and through pious particular inſtinct from God, there was euer ſome more publique forme of praier inſtituted for the greater conformitie of all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers in their manner of praiſing almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God, and for the more ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of the benefits &amp; mercies shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Church. How many Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpiritual Canticles, do we find compoſed in the old Teſtament, and accuſtomed to be ſaid principally and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by all thoſe, who were more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſecrated and addicted to the

               <p>THe office of the B. Virgin is alſoe in euery point anſwerable to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151538:9"/> forme of praier before mentioned, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting principally of Pſalmes, Hymnes, Canticles, and Leſſons, out of the holy Scriptures, and is in all things agreeing with the manner obſerued in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Breuiary. Concerning the antiquitie whereof, I haue vſed much diligence by inquiry amongſt learned men, and peruſing of diuers authors, to find out the certaine tyme when it was compoſed, and by whome: but cannot come to the certaine knowledge of it. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſeemeth to be of opinion, that it was compiled by <hi>Peter Damian</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Bishop of <hi>Ostia,</hi> à monke of the holie order of S.

What needs many words? he ſeemed to combate with the Queene of the world, and to gett the victory, for by theſe ſubtile machinations, he allured the religious to relinquish the ſaied office. But behold the diuine iuſtice which is euer vigilant, obſeruing our iniquities. shortly after ſuch aduerſities a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fell vpon the ſaied Monaſtery, that the monkes were daily in daunger to looſe their liues on euery ſide: there were made roberies and rapines of their goods, their corne was burnt, and their familiar friends and ſeruants were murthered, in

               <p>There remaineth yet one other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that none of the leaſt, which may ſeeme to haue moued the holy Church to elect this number, of howers: &amp; that is becauſe in them (as <hi>S.

I will here breefly expreſſe thoſe myſteries. In the night tyme our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt did aſſume humane flesh in the wombe of the B.

               <p>Some holy men well experienced in internall affaires doe affirme, that we haue certaine affections towards God that reſide in our ſoules, which require onely a good will to expreſſe them: and that it importeth little, whether this be done by ſignificant words, or by words that haue noe ſenſe or connection in in them at all, or by exteriour ſignes, or otherwiſe how ſoe euer; ſo that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereby to manifeſt the loue we interiourly conceiue and feele, &amp; deſire to make knowne vnho him in the beſt manner we are able. One that is tongue tyed from his birth, but hath his feete or other parts at libertie, may praiſe God deuoutly by ſignes of exultation, ſighs, or beating of his breſt. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> writeth of himſelf, that after he had implored the diuine aſſiſtance by violent beating of his breſt, and continuall teares: it ſeemed vnto him very often, that he was amongſt the quiers of Angels, by reaſon of the wonderfull ſweetnes, peace, and ſpirituall ioy of his conſcience, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151538:20"/> almighty God ſent him after ſuch pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and hereupon it is, that he is commonly pictured with à ſtone in his hand, and his breaſt naked.</p>
               <p>In the hiſtory of <hi>S. Francis</hi> is declared, that one of the diſciples of that holy Saint did for the moſt part vſe the vowell V. V. V. for his praier; and that with often repeating thereof, he was many tymes rapt into great extaſies: and the like hath hapned alſoe to diuers others, who haue vſed bodily geſtures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigence of the ſoule well affected.</p>
               <p>The ſpirituall ſweetnes which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued into our ſoules by reciting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine office in the latin tongue, doth ſpring principally from two fountaines. The one is, from our ready and humble obedience to the ordinance of the holy Church, refuſing all election on our part, and accepting that as beſt and moſt conuenient for vs, which she hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the conformitie of true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in their manner of praiſing God. The other is, from the words themſelues which haue proceeded from the mouth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151538:21"/> of almigtie God, and haue been dictated by his holy ſpirit to the Prophets, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, Apoſtles, and other Saints: for theſe words originally coming from God, are moſt delightfull and pleaſing vnto him, &amp; doe cauſe à greater ſweetnes to the ſoule in exerciſing them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning them towards God. Both which comforts are indifferent to the learned &amp; vnlearned: for it reſteth not ſo much in the dulneſſe or ſubtilitie of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as in the weaknes or force and goodnes of the will to performe this worke, that it may be iudged more or leſſe acceptable in the ſight of God. Wherefore let the vnlearned endeauour with all their forces to <hi>Pray in spirit,</hi> that is, with à recollected mind inflamed and lifted vp to God. Let them I ſaie in this ſort preſent their deuotions before the throne of God. Let them intend to praiſe him with all their ſtrength and might, and to be gratefull vnto him for his benefits. Let them buſy themſelues in this alone, and their reward will no doubt infinitly exceed their labours.</p>
               <p>Thus much might ſuffice concerning

               <p>Concerning which you are to note, that the Apoſtle in this place doth not ſpeake of the diuine office, or publique praiers of the Church; which euen from the beginning were celebrated in the Chriſtian <hi>Aſſemblyes</hi> in the common or knowne languages, that is to ſaie, either in the Hebrew Greeke or Latin, and not in euery particular vulgar tongue: but he ſpeaketh there of the Hymnes, Canticles, and praiers, which ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons, vnto whome God almightie had graunted the guift of tongues, were accuſtomed to pronounce at their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in their owne name, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by themſelues.

By this it is plaine that the prayers of the holy Church in an vnknowne language are nothing contrary to the Apoſtles mynd: and that for two reaſons, firſt becauſe ſuch praier is inſtituted more for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing and worshiping God, then for the inſtruction of thoſe that pray: and ſecondly becauſe ſuch deuout ſacrifices ſpiritually offered to God, doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151538:30"/> another, ouerpaſſe nothing, nor make too much haſt; and endeauouring to pronounce euery word diſtinctly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is Attention to the ſenſe of the words, which may be obſerued by attending to the ſenſe or meaning of the words either literall or myſticall, that your affections maie be inflamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>The Third is Attention either to God, or to the thing wee demaunde of him; which maie alſoe be kept by attending to the preſence of God; contemplating his infinite goodnes, that is gratiouſly pleaſed to be euer preſent with vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our actions, rewarding what is well done, and rectifying what is amiſſe: or by conuerting our thoughts to our ſweet Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus; calling to mind the infinite loue where with he wrought that admirable worke of our Redemption, and taking for our ſubiect to ruminate vpon ſome one or more of the paſſadges of his holy life, or bitter paſſion; &amp; afterwards ſometimes darting our affections and gratitude towards
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151538:30"/> him, by ſome short but efficacious or burning aſpiration: or by hauing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the benefitts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e aske of God (vizt) either Chaſtitie, Humilitue, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Faith, Hope, the diuine loue, euerlaſting life, or the like.</p>
               <p>As for example, whileſt we recite the Pſalme <hi>Venite exultemus,</hi> to thinke vpon theſe words in the myſtery of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Let vs make ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our image and likenes,</hi> diſcourſing breifly there of in our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. As thus, O great dignitie to be like to God. With what care ought I to conſerue this thy image in my ſoule? Graunt me my deare Lord, that I neuer defile it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the like. And whileſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the reſt of the parts of the office, to take to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome thing of the life, paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or death of our Sauiour, beginning with the myſterie of his holy Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſcourſing thereof in our interiour. As thas, O my ſoule behold the force of loue! That we might become the ſonnes of God, God became the ſonne of à poore maide, or the like: ſometimes prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing almightie God, ſometimes giuing thankes vnto him, and ſometimes beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151538:31"/> ſome grace or benefitt according to our neceſſitie, at other tymes wishing that his will may be accomplished in and by vs and all creatures, reſigning our ſelues to be diſpoſed of by him for tyme and eternitie, as maie be for his greater glory. In which imployment if we ſpend the whole tyme that we are reciting the office, it will be very profitably ſpent, notwithſtanding that we be ſoe attent thereunto, that we ſcarce perceiue that we are reciting the words of the office.</p>
               <p>The firſt member of this diuiſion will ſuffice, but yet it is the meaneſt Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond is better, but yet is proper onely to ſchollers, or ſuch whome God almightie hath illuminated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie fauour, whoe can picke out here and there pious conſiderations to moue their affections. The Third is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held the beſt, &amp; is indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both to the learned and vnlearned. Sharpneſſe of witt, and ſubtilitie of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is not ſoe much required to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this well, as is à good will and pure intention: for as <hi>S.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151538:31"/> by this attention are very often ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated in ſpirit aboue themſelues, and all things created.</p>
               <p>If thoſe that are learned will vſe their vnderſtanding in this affaire, noe further or other wiſe, but to excite their will, by propoſing ſweet and mouing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto her, and helping her by prettie induſtries of loue to continue her holie deſires and affections, then they maie ſeeme to haue aduantage of the ſimple and vnlearned in the practiſe of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: but if they doe vſe their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſearch curiouſly into hidden Myſteries with quiddities of art, and buſie themſelues more in ſpeculation, then in procuring and conſeruing good affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then are they farre short of ſimple and ignorant, but well minded ſoules; for ſuch their meditation will proue ſterill, and altogether voide of that fruit which should be ſought by meditation, which it pious, holie, and ardent affections and deſires to inflame our ſoules with diuine loue.

               <p>In the Cronicles of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his order
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151538:32"/> it is regiſtred, that one <hi>Brother Giles</hi> of the order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> an vnlearned but à holie man, on à time ſpake to <hi>S.

The good Brother <hi>Giles</hi> replied: And can then an ignorant perſon loue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as well as à learned man? Yea (ſaied <hi>S.

Where upon the good Brother tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with exceffiue feruour of ſpirit, went inſtantly into that part of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151538:33"/> which looked towards the towne, and with à ſtrong voice cried out.

               <p>The Third diuiſion is into à formall attention, and à vertuall, which may be gathered alſoe out of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle à fore cited.</p>
               <p>A formall Attention is that by which we keepe our minds actually buſied about one of the ſaied three Attentions, (vizt) either to the words, to their ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to God or ſonie other pious matter.</p>
               <p>A vertuall Attention is that which is thought to remaine by force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the purpoſe or intention framed in the beginning of our praier, to attend by one of the ſaied three waies. This attention doth morally perſeuer, and hath influence into our praier, vntill
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151538:33"/> by ſome other act wee doe expreſſely, or implicitely recall or diſanull it? A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall attention is the beſt: but ſuch is our frailtie and weaknes, that few are found, who can continue any long tyme in it &amp; therefore God almighty vnto whome our infirmities are well knowne, doth not exact it as abſolutly neceſſary during our praier, but is graciouſly well pleaſed with our vertuall attention, as beſt agreeing with the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſince our fall by the ſinne of our firſt parents.

               <p>The firſt is the want of watchfulneſſe ouer our hearts out of praier, by which meanes our minds are filled and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with à rabble of vnpro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſing therefore that it is not onely lawfull but exceeding commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for two or more to recite this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice together, I will here ſet downe what Order is to be obſerued, when any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aboue two doe concurre thereunto.</p>
               <p>If Three or more deſire to performe the Office together, they are to diuide themſelues into two parts: that is to ſaie,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151538:50"/> if there be three of them, two are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one verſe, and the third the verſe following; if there be Fower of them, two are to recite one verſe, and the other two the verſe following: and ſoe forth, be they neuer ſoe many. Yet this alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is properly vſed in reading the Pſalmes and Hymnes: for in the other parts of the office it ſufficeth that one or two doe recite them, and the reſt attend with diligence. The preparatiue Praiers are to be ſaied by all in à low voice onely audible by themſelues: but the Pſalme <hi>Venite exultemus,</hi> the Chapters, and Praiers are to be ſaied by one alone, the reſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering as is appointed in thoſe places. The Antiphones, Leſſons, and Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories are to be read by one of each ſide, the reſt giuing attention.</p>
               <p>When many recite the office together, it is not needfull to haue attention to all of them, but it ſufficeth to heare any of them. I haue obſerued ſome in reciting the office with others to mumble ſoftly to themſelues the others part: which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is much to be diſliked; both for that it occaſioneth ſcruples, as alſoe for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151538:50"/> that ſuch whiſpering doth often diſturbe others, hinder their owne attention, and tacitly infringe the common practiſe of alternation. Wherefore ſuch are to know, that it is farre better for them to attend diligently to what the other part doth recite, and ſpare ſuch their ſuper fluous and preiudiciall labour. But perhaps they will ſaie, that they cannot ſometymes heare diſtinctly what the other doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite: to which maie be anſwered, that they are not bound to heare euery word diſtinctly pronounced; but it ſufficeth, that they perceiue the others are not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in performing their part, and they themſelues haue liſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>For as much as concerneth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reciting in priuate the diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and conſequently the office of the B. Virgin by one alone: the practiſe in all ages doth likewiſe shew it to be both ſufficient and conuenient. Yet becauſe ſome clauſes or paſſages in the ſaied offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeeme to ſuppoſe more then one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concurring, as for example, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions which are giuen in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151538:51"/> number, and <hi>Venite exultemus, Come let vs reioyce,</hi> the word <hi>Oremus, Let vs pray,</hi> which is vſually recited before euery Praier, <hi>Benedicamus Domino,</hi> and diuers others where in the plurall numbers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: In anſwer there vnto, I will here ſet downe what <hi>Peeter Damian</hi> in his booke entituled <hi>Dominus vobiſcum</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth in generall to ſuch like obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. vz. That the rule of Eccleſiaſticall tradition is to be vniformely obſerued, whether the office be recited by one alone or more. For (ſaieth he) if the Doctors of the Church had iudged it meet, they would haue preſcribed one forme of the diuine office for one alone, and an other for two or more: which ſince they haue not, but haue taught vs to keepe one order with inuiolable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance, we are to obey their holie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; which is founded vpon good reaſon, deduced out of the authoritie of the holie Scriptures. For they foreſaw that whatſoeuer is offered with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence in the diuine office by euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of the holie Church, the ſame is exhibited vniuerſally by the faith
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151538:51"/> and deuotion of the whole Church, for the Spirit of the Church is one, where with one body is viuificated or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which is gouerned by Chriſt the head thereof. Moreouer the whole Church doth conſiſt of à coniuncture of diuers members, yet it is without doubt but one body, founded vpon the ſoliditie of one faith, and anoynted with one vertue of the viuificating Spirit: whence it is that the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>One body and one Spirit, as you are called in one hope of your vocation.</hi> Wherefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Epiſt. of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Probus</hi> in the 12. Chapter, where he writeth, That if we doe praie well, and as we ought, we cannot ſaie any thing which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Lords praier. For Praier is as it were an interpreter of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire towards God. Wherefore praying well, we aske thoſe things onely, which we maie well deſire: And in our Lords praier are not onely asked all things which we maie well deſire, but alſoe in that order or methode wherein they should be deſired For firſt of all the end it ſelf is deſired, and afterwards the meanes which conduce thereunto. Our end indeed is God, towards whome our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tendeth in à twofold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151538:67"/> the one by deſiring his glory, the other by deſiring to be partakers thereof. The firſt proceedeth from that charitie where with we loue ourſelues in God: and therefore the Petition <hi>Sanctified be thy name,</hi> is put in the firſt place, by which we firſt ſeeke the glory of God; and next <hi>Let thy Kingdome cona,</hi> by which we deſire to attaine to the glory of his Kingdome. The meanes by which wee are furthered in attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this end doth conduce in one of theſe two manners, vdzt, either of it ſelf, or by accident. Of it ſelf that good doth conduce which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for this end. And that which is profitable for the obtaining beatitude is profitable two waies: the one directly and principally, of which ſort are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious works; and to this the Third Petition, <hi>Let thy will be done,</hi> hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>Three reaſons maie be giuen, why it was not meet that the Angells should in tymes paſt reuerence men, but rather men reuerence Angells. The firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Angells are replenished with the ſplendor of the diuine grace, which is the reaſon that they euer appeare with brightneſſe and glory: but in men, if they participate any thing at all of this grace, yet it is very little, and euer for the moſt part accompanied with à certaine obſcuritie. The Second becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are familiar with God, and men are remote and eſtranged from him by ſinne. The Third becauſe the Angells are pure Spirits, and men of à nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption. Wherefore it was not conuenient that the Angells should reuerence any humane creature, vntill
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151538:70"/> here might be found ſuch an one, who did exceed them in theſe three qualities: and this one was the B. Virgin, and therefore the Angell ſaluted her with theſe words, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The firſt is, becauſe praier is an act of religion, and God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is to be worshiped in that ſort. The Second is, becauſe it is proper to God alone to know our praier, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we praie mentally. The Third is, becauſe if we doe praie to any of the SS. it is not but onely in regard they are conioyned to God: but there are ſome that yet liue in this world, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151538:75"/> others that remaine in Purgatory, who are nearely conioyned to God by grace, vnto whome notwithſtanding we are not to praie, nor conſequently to the SS. in Paradiſe. Neuertheleſſe this holy S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the firſt manner we offer our praier to God alone: for that all our praiers ought to be ordained to obtaine grace and glory: which God alone doth giue, according to that of the Pſalme, <hi>Our Lord will giue</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 83</note>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er we offer our praiers to the holie Angells and men: not that God maie know our requeſts by them, but that our praiers maie haue their deſired effect graunted by their interceſſion and merits.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151538:76"/> is doth exceedingly benefitt their excellencie to know ſuch petitions as are exhibited vnto them, whether they be made vocally or mentally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they doe know the petitions we exhibit, God manifeſting them. To the laſt obiection he anſwereth, that thoſe who are in this world, or in Purgatory doe not as yet enioy the cleare viſion of the Word, that thereby they might know what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hauing shewed that it is lawfull to praie to Saints, and in what manner we ought to addreſſe our Petitions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it will be needfull alſoe to proue, that they both maie and doe praie for vs; for otherwiſe if they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could nor would interceed for vs, it were in vaine to implore their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Concerning which <hi>S. Thomas</hi> aboue named frameth Fiue reaſons, why it should ſeeme, that the Saints now in glory neither maie, nor doe praie for vs.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:151538:76"/>
                  <p>The Firſt is, becauſe an act of any one is more meritorious for himſelf, then for others: but the Saints now in glory doe not merit, nor praie for themſelues, becauſe they are conſtituted in the end, for which they were created; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently doe they praie for vs.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, becauſe the Saints doe conforme their will perfectly to the will of God, ſoe that they deſire nothing but what God will: but that which God will is alwaies fulfilled; wherefore it ſeemeth in vaine that the Saints should praie for vs.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, becauſe as the Saints in glory are in a more eminent degree then we, ſoe likewiſe are thoſe that are in Purgatory; becauſe they cannot now ſinne: but thoſe that are in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory doe not praie for vs, but rather we for them; nor conſequently the Saints in glory.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, becauſe if the Saints in glory did praie for vs, the praier of the ſuperiour Saints would be of greateſt efficacie: and conſequently we ought not to implore the ſuffrage of the praiers

                  <p>The Fift is, becauſe the ſoule of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not <hi>Peter:</hi> and therefore if the ſoules of the Saints did praie for vs, whileſt they are ſeperated from their bodies, we should not intreat <hi>S.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding this holy Saint doth hold the contrary to be true: which he confirmeth by that of the <hi>Machabees, This is he that praieth much for the people and for the whole Citie, Ieremie the Prophet of God.</hi> Afterwards he explicateth the ſtate of the queſtion as followeth, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> (ſaieth he) doth affirme that it was the error of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> the heretike, That whileſt we liue, we maie mutually praie for one an other: but after we are departed this life, no mans praier for an other is heard; eſpecially ſince that the Martyrs doe deſire to haue their bloud reuenged, and can not obtaine it. But
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151538:79"/> this opinion is altogether falſe: for ſince that Praier exhibited for a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Charitie; by how much the Saints in the celeſtiall countrey are of more perfect charitie, by ſoe much the more doe they praie for vs that are but vpon the way to beatitude, and maie haue help by their praier, and by how much they are more immediatly vnited to God, by ſoe much the more are their praiers of greater efficacie: for ſuch is the diuine ordinance that there should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infuſed of the excellencie of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour powers into the inferiour, as of the ſplendor or brightnes of the ſunne into the aire.

                  <p>Finally to the firſt obiection he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151538:80"/> that noe beatitude is wanting to the Saints, who are in the celeſtiall countrey, ſeeing that they are bleſſed, but the glory of the body, for which they doe praie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they praie for vs, who are not as yet come to the laſt perfection of beatitude; and their praiers haue power to impetrate from two cauſes, that is to ſaie, from their owne precedent merits, and the diuine acceptance.</p>
                  <p>To the Second he anſwereth, that the Saints doe obtaine by requeſt, what God hath decreed to graunt by meanes of their praiers: and they deſire what they eſteeme is to be accomplished by their praiers, according to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>To the Third he anſwereth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Purgatory be in à more eminent degree then we, in regard they cannot ſinne; yet are they inferiour to vs, in ſoe much as concerneth the paines they ſuffer: and according to this they are not in ſtate of praying for others, but rather that praier should be exhibited for them.</p>
                  <p>To the Fourth he anſwereth, that it is the will of God that all inferiour
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151538:80"/> things should haue help of the ſuperiour and therefore it is expedient not onely to implore the aſſiſtance of the ſuperiour but of inferiour Saints alſoe, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the mercie of God alone were to be implored. Howbeit it happeneth ſometymes that deuout praier made to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inferiour Saint is moſt effectuall; either for that this is performed with greater feruour, or becauſe it is the diuine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereby to manifeſt the holineſſe of that Saint.</p>
                  <p>Finally to the Fift he anſwereth, that becauſe the Saints in their life tyme haue merited that they maie praie for vs: therefore we doe inuocate them by the names where with they were called in this world; by which alſoe they are beſt knowne vnto vs: and moreouer to inſinuate our beleife of the reſurrection, as it is read in <hi>Exodus, I am the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham &amp;c.</hi> Thus farre are the words of this holie S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. whoſe doctrine or rather the doctrine of the holy Catholike Church in this point of praying to Saint is very learnedly proued by <hi>Suarez</hi> in his ſecond Tome <hi>de Virtute &amp; statu reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis</hi>

                  <p>S. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> in his mirrour of the B. Virgin hath words to this effect, In this admirable ſalutation (ſaieth he) there are contained fiue moſt ſweet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, in which are inſinuated vnto vs fiue moſt delightfull commendations, or

Firſt she was moſt pure, becauſe she was with out blame; and therefore the word <hi>Aue</hi> was properly applied by the Angel, ſignifying thereby, that she<note place="margin">Tom. 6. pa. 430.

                  <p>Secondly she was moſt replenished with aboundance of grace, <hi>Full of grace.</hi> She was truely full, and aboundantly full, as <hi>Saint Anſelme</hi> affirmeth ſaying,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151538:83"/> O woman full and more then full of grace, by whoſe exceſſe and ouerflowing plenitude all creatures are bedewed, and recouer life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly she was moſt ſecure by the preſence of God, <hi>Our Lord is with thee.

                  <p>Fiftly she is moſt profitable for the excellencie of her ofspring, <hi>Bleſſed is the fruit of thy wombe.</hi> For she brought forth that moſt excellent and potent fruit which gaue ſaluation to the whole world. <hi>Saint Anſelme</hi> vpon theſe words

                  <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his Liturgy hath words to this effect, Let vs make commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our moſt holie, moſt immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, moſt glorious, and moſt B.

Admit our praiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy holie place of audience, and bring vs backe the Antidote of reconciliation. Accept what we offer, returne what we requeſt, excuſe what we feare. By thee we hope to haue pardon of our offences, becauſe thou art the ſole hope of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and in thee moſt bleſſed is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of our rewards. Holie <hi>Marie</hi> ſuccour the afflicted, help the weake minded, cherish thoſe that weepe, praie for the people, be à meane for the Clergy, make interceſſion for the deuout femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſexe, Let all feele thy aſſiſtance,

                     <hi>Petrus Chriſologus Archbishop of Rauenna</hi> ſaieth, That an Angell did treat with <hi>Marie</hi> concerning Saluation, becauſe an Angell had treated with <hi>Eue</hi> concerning Ruine. &amp; in another place he ſaieth, She is truely bleſſed, who was greater then heauen, ſtronger then the earth, and more ſpacious then the world: for she contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God, whome the world is not able to containe, she bore God who beareth the world, she brought forth her Creator, and nourished the nourisher of all the liuing</p>

                     <hi>Fulgentius Ruſpenſis</hi> in à Sermon in the praiſe of the B.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151538:86"/> accurſed, whome we beleeue to haue paſſed to the benediction of glory through <hi>Marie.</hi> Come therefore all you that are Virgins to the Virgin, Come all you that conceiue to her that concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Come all you that bring forth to her that did bring forth, Come all you that giue ſucke to her that gaue ſucke, and you little young maids come alſoe to her that was à little young maid: for the B. Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> hath for this cauſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt all theſe courſes of nature, that she might be able to comfort, and aſſiſt all ſorts of women, that should haue recourſe vnto her.</p>
                  <p>It will not be needfull that I inſiſt any longer vpon this ſubiect, for that the ſtudious reader will find nothing more frequent in the writings of moſt of the auncient Fathers: and therefore I will onely ſet downe two examples which maie be à meanes to confirme ſuch as exerciſe this deuotion towards the B. Virgin, and encouradge others to the like office of pietie.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Tome of the flowers of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151538:86"/> examples is related out of diuers graue authors, that à certaine venerable Archbp of Canterburie returning from the court of Rome did take vp his lodging in the famous and Princely Monaſterie of Saint <hi>Bertin</hi> in the Citie of Saint <hi>Omers</hi> of the holie Order of Saint <hi>Benedict:</hi> and the daie following was conducted into the Chapter howſe; where he made à ſpeech to the Religious: in which amongſt other remarkable things he declared vnto them, that when he was at <hi>Benenentum</hi> he vnderſtood of à certaine Religious man who was accuſtomed to recite daily Fiue Pſalmes in the honor of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which began with the fiue letters of her name. The Pſalmes were theſe <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat, Ad Dominum, Retribue, In conuertendo</hi> and <hi>Ad te leuaui,</hi> before euery one of which he ſaied the Angelicall Salutation or <hi>Aue Maria.</hi> There was preſent at this Sermon one <hi>Ioſeius à Monke</hi> of the ſaied Monaſterie of <hi>S. Bertin,</hi> who gaue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attention to what was ſaied, and did from that tyme daily when he had ended <hi>Mattins</hi> recite the ſaied Pſalmes in the manner aboue ſaied. It happened
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151538:87"/> one night about the feaſt of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle, that the reſt of the Religious riſing to the night office, the ſaied <hi>Ioſcius</hi> was abſent. The Subprior therefore loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about the Quire (as the manner is) to ſee who was abſent, perceaued him wanting, and went ſtraight to his chamber, and found him dead: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon returning to the Quire he called together the Religious, and brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their deceaſed Brother; where after they had vncouered his face they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this wonderfull ſpectacle, Fiue Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes did iſſue out of his face, one whereof ſprong out of his mouth and tongue, one out of each eie, and one out of each noſtrill. There former ſorrow therefore being changed into exceſſiue ioy at the ſight of this ſoe great à mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151538:87"/> &amp; Laietie beheld this admirable worke of God. This happened about the yeare of our Lord 1162. <hi>Leo</hi> being Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of the ſaied Monaſterie, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doricus</hi> Earle of that I rouince.</p>

                     <hi>Cantiprat</hi> in his ſecond Booke of the Vniuerſe, relateth à wonderfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle not vnlike to the former of à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine auncient ſouldier, who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Nouiship in à Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Ciſtercians, proued ſoe indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; that he could not be brought to learne our Lords Praier: wherefore his Maiſter endeauored with much labour to reach him the Angelicall Salutation, which likewiſe proued ſoe difficult à taſke vnto him, that he could not after much tyme and induſtry retaine in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory any more of it, then theſe words <hi>Aue Maria gratia plena Dominus tecum.</hi> Theſe words therefore by aduice of his Maiſter he volued and reuolued and ruminated in all places, yea euen at meale tyme: and at length by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance conceiued ſoe great ſweetnes in them, that the ſole memory of the Mother of God did poſſeſſe his heart
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151538:88"/> and mouth in what buſines ſoeuer he was imploved. Some yeares being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this deuotion, this holie man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed this life for à better, and being buried in the Church yard, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there grew out of his graue à tree of ſuch à ſort of wood which was not vſuall in thoſe parts, in the leaues where of were ingrauen in golden letters <hi>Aue Maria gratia plena.</hi> The Bishop of the Dioceſe hauing notice giuen him hereof by the Abbot of that Monaſterie, came to the graue accompanied with à great multitude of people; and after he had veiwed the ſaied tree, cauſed ſome to digge about it, and found that it tooke roote in the mouth of the ſaied holie man. The ſaied tree hauing as it should ſeeme performed the office for which it grew (vdzt) to giue reſtimonie of the ſanctitie of that holie man, and how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the B.

                     <hi>OVr Lord is à refuge</hi> vnto vs, when we are inforced to fly perſecution, <hi>and strength,</hi> when we tollerate it: and in both flying and tollerating he is <hi>an helper</hi> and comforter <hi>in tribulations, which haue found vs exeeedingly,</hi> which haue happened vnto vs aboue meaſure. <hi>Therefore will wee not feare, when the earth shall bee troubled,</hi> although the earth bee wonderfully sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>and mountaines transported into the heart</hi>

Or thus, therefore we that hane placed our confidence in God, will not feare; when earthly men, who haue had their affections wholly bent vpon terrene &amp; tranſitory things, shall tremble with great horror in the daie of iudgement, and the proud and mightie men of the world shall bee throwne into the very depth and middeſt of hell. Or thus, as being the words of the Primitiue Church hauing placed her hope in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Therefore we will not feare with à carnall humane and inordinate feare when the land of <hi>Iuda,</hi> or the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall bee troubled, labouring in vaine to extirpate the young plants of Chriſt, and blot out the memory of him in mens hearts: neither will we then feare, when the Apoſtles and diſciples of Chriſt shall bee inforced to leaue <hi>Iewrie,</hi> and paſſe to the Gentils, inhabiting the middeſt of the earth. <hi>Their waters haue ſounded,</hi> the clamours &amp; falſe accuſations of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and Gentils haue ſounded before the tribunalls of the Preſidents &amp; Kings, whither they haue conuented the
